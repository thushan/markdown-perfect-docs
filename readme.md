# Perfect Documentation Example

This is an example of building great documentation for your Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Gogs, Codeberg (and others like Azure Devops) repository using VSCode and some delightful extensions.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repo and open it up within VSCode. You'll be prompted to install a few recommended extensions (described below). Then you can ask VSCode to preview the documentation (in this case, this very readme file!) and see the final outcome :-)
