# Perfect Documentation Example

This is an example of building great documentation for your Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Gogs, Codeberg (and others like Azure Devops) repository using VSCode and some delightful extensions.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repo and open it up within VSCode. You'll be prompted to install a few recommended extensions (described below). Then you can ask VSCode to preview the documentation (in this case, this very readme file!) and see the final outcome :-)

## Extensions Used

* [Street Side Software: Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) - SpellCheck your code, this extension provides the core spell-checker functionality provided to VSCode
* [Street Side Software: Australian English](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker-australian-english) - Dictionary for Australian English, nothing more annoying than seeing a Compromize when we say we don't want to Compromise, big surprise!
